Spectrum: What does a machine know about gender?
Source: [CHANNEL NAME], "[NAME]"
[URL]

Trained on a half a million images from IMDB and Wikipedia, the Spectrum project looks at the intersection of machine learning and the presentation of gender. While algorithm is unbiased, the training dataset (and consequently society at large) certainly has a bias. The algorithm teaches the machine to look for the common traits that we use to differentiate ourselves everyday.
